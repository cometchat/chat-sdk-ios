# CometChat SDK for iOS
The CometChat SDK is a robust toolkit that developers can utilize to swiftly incorporate a reliable and fully-featured chat functionality into an existing or new application. It removes the complexity of building a chat infrastructure from scratch, thus accelerating the development process and reducing time to market.

## Prerequisites
- XCode (Above Xcode 12 Recommended)
- iOS 11 and above 

## Getting Started
To set up iOS SDK and utilize CometChat for your chat and calls functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
- After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.
- Check the [key concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/ios/key-concepts) to understand the basic components of CometChat.
- Refer to the [Integration Steps](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/ios/setup) in our documentation to integrate the SDK into your i app.
